LMS	OpenEdX (MongoDB, MySQL)
DNS	Cloudflare
VKB	Supabase
AWS	AI

Voice/Chat Assistant Stack
- AI Speech Synthesis: RimeAI (lifelike, Low Latency)
- LLM: OpenAI 4o-mini (low latency, excelent at conversational AI)
- Transcriber: Deepgram (High Quality, Low latency)
- Tools: 
  - Function Calling:
    - Query_Tool used to retrieve data from knowlege base.
    - Custom OpenEdX Connector for two way communication between AI and LMS (TBD).
  - MCP:
    - Supabase Integration for possible 2-way communication between AI and services (TBD).
    - Brave API used to give agentic browser Search capabilities (TBD).
    - VAPI Knowlege Base connection for consistant memory between chat/voice (TBD).
- Knowlege Base for long term context retrieval with vector embeddings.
- Integrations (TBD): 
  - SIP/Vanity Phone number Providers (if needed; out of initial scope)
  - Webhook Server authenitcation (for securing down webhooks).
  - Storage (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, or Google; TBD and if needed)
  - Slack, Google Calendar, Make.com (Flows),
  - Supabase (centralized & scaleable VKB), 
  - Tavus (video generation; TBD)

Notes:
- Has the ability to take calls (make calls with flow)
- Current iteration has ~500-700ms latency; to improve this would mean getting Enterprise access to Amazon Bedrock (for LLM, reduce latency by ~200-250ms), RimeAI (reduce by ~100ms), and Deepgram (unknown).
- Amazon Bedrock requires Custom LLM development and setup of their platform (which is involved), so it's been excluded from the first iteration).

Other Notes:
- Cloudflare for DNS, Loadbalancing, etc.
- Health Check and Monitoring (with notifications)
- S3 Bucket/storage option?

Voice Assistant Improvements:
- Bug: Confuses not having access to audio input with text input.
- Split up system prompt to domain specifics (spit docs/persona, etc. to KB)
- Consolidate documentation and the like.
- Add summary of user conversations to user knowlege base.

Future Scope
- Multi-language support
- Amazon Route 53 health checks
