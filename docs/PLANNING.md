# PLANNING

## Methodology
This document outlines the planning methodology, scope, and design decisions for the Voice Assistance xBlock integration.

### Design Thinking Process
The development follows a design thinking approach with these phases:

1. **Empathize**: Understanding learner needs through user research
   - Pain points in current learning experiences
   - Expectations for voice assistance
   - Accessibility considerations
2. **Define**: Defining the core problems to solve
   - Learning context understanding
   - Seamless assistance delivery
   - Multi-modal input preferences
3. **Ideate**: Generating solution approaches
   - Floating UI vs. embedded components
   - Proactive vs. reactive assistance
   - Voice customization options
4. **Prototype**: Creating testable implementations
   - UI wireframes and mockups
   - Voice interaction flows
   - Backend service integration
5. **Test**: Validating with users
   - User testing sessions
   - Feedback collection
   - Iteration cycles

### Agile Development Approach

The implementation follows Agile methodology with:
- Two-week sprint cycles
- Continuous integration and deployment
- Feature prioritization based on user impact

## Scope

### Core Capabilities
- **AI-Powered Assistance**: Using VAPI.ai to provide intelligent responses
- **Voice Input/Output**: Natural speech interactions
- **Context Awareness**: Leveraging course structure and user progress
- **Customization**: User control over voice parameters
- **History Management**: Recording and retrieving past interactions
- **Sesame CSM-1B integration**: SOTA TTS offering natural pauses, interruptions, emotional tone.

### Integration Points
1. **OpenEdX Platform**:
   - Course navigation hooks
   - User progress tracking
   - Authentication integration
   - Tutor deployment compatibility
2. **VAPI.ai API**:
   - Speech-to-text processing
   - Text-to-speech generation
   - Dialog management
   - API key and Assistant ID configuration
3. **UI/UX Integration**:
   - Floating interface with custom icons
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Accessibility compliance
   - Feedback collection mechanism

### Project Phases
1. **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**:
   - Basic voice interaction
   - Simple floating UI
   - Core assistance capabilities
2. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Context awareness
   - Voice customization
   - History tracking
3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Proactive assistance
   - Analytics integration
   - Advanced personalization

## Design Decisions

### UI/UX Approach
Selected a floating button with expandable chat interface because:
- Minimizes screen real estate when not in use
- Provides consistent access throughout the learning experience
- Supports both desktop and mobile experiences
- Allows for proactive notifications without disrupting content

### Technical Architecture
Chose xBlock format to:
- Ensure compatibility with OpenEdX ecosystem
- Enable easy installation by course authors
- Leverage existing OpenEdX services
- Maintain proper separation of concerns

### Voice Customization
Prioritized these voice settings based on user research:
- Speaking speed (critical for comprehension)
- Voice selection (personalization)
- Language (accessibility)
- Volume (environmental adaptation)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| API rate limiting | High | Medium | Implement caching and request throttling |
| Browser compatibility | Medium | Low | Test across major browsers and versions |
| User adoption | High | Medium | Provide clear onboarding and tooltips |
| Performance impact | Medium | Medium | Optimize asset loading and background processing |
| Tutor build issues | High | Medium | Ensure proper package structure and dependencies |
| Icon compatibility | Low | Low | Use SVG icons with fallbacks for older browsers |
